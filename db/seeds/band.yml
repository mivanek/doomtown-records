Brat Pack:
  description:Hailing from the eastern part of The Netherlands comes a band that you would expect from the western and sunny side of California. The band started in 2006 and not long after that they recorded a demo which was well received by critics and fans. Playing festivals such as Light The Fuse/Trashfest and also attending the 5 year anniversary for Punx.nl shows that this band is not just a punkrock band ...but lots more. With ex- and current members of Beans, Antillectual, My Reply and Citizens Patrol they have a wide variety of musicians in the band and that's something you distinctly hear in their sound. Influences vary from the melodic sounds of Nofx (take note off the melodic guitar intros), Bad Religion, No Use For A Name but with a harder edge than any of these bands using influences of hardcore bands such as RKL, Stalag 13, 7 seconds en old New York and DC hardcore bands like Minor Threat and Urban Waste. In 2007 their demo was re-released by Gummopunx/Misspelled Yuoth and Pick-up records. Not long after that they started to record a full-length album which is now ready to be released and to be played all summer. Brat Pack delivers 13 songs of full excitement and loads of melodies which will have you dancing in no time and also set a standard for the next generation of punkrock bands to come.

  The bands first album "Hate The Neighbours" was recorded by the infamous Menno Bakker at the Bunt studios in the end of 2007. It was released early May 2008 by Crucial Attack (The Netherlands), Dirty Faces (Germany) and Ha-Ko Bastards (Serbia). The album contains 13 songs ranging from fast songs clocking in around a minute (think RKL, Minor Threat) to more mid-tempo songs, influenced by bands such as the Adolescents and Agent Orange. Lyrics deal with political themes, such as consumerism, the war in Iraq, xenophobia and the hypocrisy of politicians themselves, as well as more personal themes.

Black Gust:
  description: The band plays a mutant fusion of good old 80's hardcore and garage punk drenched in gloomy riffs accompanied by snotty vocals & bitter lyrics. These fuck-ups have been compared to the Adolescents, Gang Green, RKL, "late era" Poison Idea, Turbonegro and some "newer" bands such as Annihilation Time, Night Fever and Leathervein.
