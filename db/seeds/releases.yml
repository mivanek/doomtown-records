    format: vinyl
    genre: Rock
    style: Alternative Rock, Punk, Post-Punk, Noise, No Wave
    label: Bučni Stripovi, Dare The Divine, Doomtown
    review: If you enjoy noise pangs created by bands such as The Birthday Party, Pop Group or Killing Joke or some more obscure nihilists such as Drunks With Guns or Stick Men With Rayguns, you will not be disappointed by Trobecove Krusne Peci. Just like cult ex-yugoslavian bands such as Sexa, Paraf, Šarlo Akrobata, Pekinška Patka, Quod Massacre, Kaos etc., TKP were one of the most important bands of their time even thought they never managed to put out a proper record so we are really proud of participating in this one.

      This is official repress of TKP old recordings which are newly remastered from the original master tapes. "S Mukom Žva?u Trubadurov Vrat" feature classic "85" tape on 180 gram vinyl plus two compilation compact disc's featuring classic "Ta Krvava Prošlost" tape and bunch of unreleased material, live material and some live video footage from rehearsal space and their live performances from the back in the 80's. Vinyl comes in a gatefold sleeve with a luxurious 6 page insert.

    style: Punk Rock, Hardcore
    label: DHP/AK47 Records, Doomtown Records, Napravi Zaedno, Nuclear Chaos, World's Appreciated Kitsch, Guranje S Litice
    review: The band plays a mutant fusion of good old 80's hardcore and garage punk drenched in gloomy riffs accompanied by snotty vocals & bitter lyrics. These fuck-ups have been compared to the Adolescents, Gang Green, RKL, "late era" Poison Idea, Turbonegro and some "newer" bands such as Annihilation Time, Night Fever and Leathervein.

Brat Pack:
  Hate the Neighbours:
    format: cd
    genre: Punk
    style: Hardcore
    label: Crucial Attack Records, Dirty Faces Records, HA-KO Bastards records
    review: Brat Pack's first album "Hate The Neighbours" was recorded by the infamous Menno Bakker at the Bunt studios in the end of 2007. It was released early May 2008 by Crucial Attack (The Netherlands), Dirty Faces (Germany) and Ha-Ko Bastards (Serbia). The album contains 13 songs ranging from fast songs clocking in around a minute (think RKL, Minor Threat) to more mid-tempo songs, influenced by bands such as the Adolescents and Agent Orange. Lyrics deal with political themes, such as consumerism, the war in Iraq, xenophobia and the hypocrisy of politicians themselves, as well as more personal themes

  Stupidity Returns:
    format: cd
    genre: Punk
    style: Hardcore
    label: Crucial Attack Records, Dirty Faces Records, HA-KO Bastards records
    review: Bratpack's last record, Hate the Neighbours, got released in 2008. In the meantime they have been playing a shitload of shows, went on several tours and managed to squeeze out new songs to fit this here new record. It shows a great maturing process (something that can't be said on a personal level by the way…) without losing the style that is grasped from the start. So yes, you can still think Adolescents, SNFU, RKL, NoFX and anything in between. Relieved? Well, i am!
