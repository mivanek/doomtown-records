Brat Pack:
  description: Hailing from the eastern part of The Netherlands comes a band that you would expect from the western and sunny side of California. The band started in 2006 and not long after that they recorded a demo which was well received by critics and fans. With ex- and current members of Beans, Antillectual, My Reply and Citizens Patrol they have a wide variety of musicians in the band. Influences vary from the melodic sounds of Nofx, Bad Religion and No Use For A Name, but with a harder edge than any of these bands. In 2007 their demo was re-released by Gummopunx/Misspelled Yuoth and Pick-up records.

Black Gust:
  description: The band plays a mutant fusion of good old 80's hardcore and garage punk drenched in gloomy riffs accompanied by snotty vocals & bitter lyrics. These fuck-ups have been compared to the Adolescents, Gang Green, RKL, "late era" Poison Idea, Turbonegro and some "newer" bands such as Annihilation Time, Night Fever and Leathervein.
